Project 1: Character Battle
--- 

In this assignment the goal was to make a Pokemon-esque mini battling game. I decided to go a little overboard as this was my first major project since returning to college.

How to run (3 Options)
--- 
1. Download and open project with your IDE, run main method in CharacterBattle class
2. Download and run in the console. If you don't know how, check out [this freecodecamp.org article](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-execute-and-run-java-code/).
3. Download just the .jar file if you want. It's in the folder labeled "CharacterBattleJar". Double-click to run.

Note: You need to have the [JRE](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/whatis_java.html) installed for all these methods.

Playing the game
---
The game is quite simple, and should be self explanatory. Upon launch, follow the prompts.

"Let's Fight!"    =>   Single or Two-Player games

"Battle for me?"  =>   Auto-fights with some pseudo-randomly chosen characters, based on BattleBots robots.

"I'm too scared!" =>   Closes the game

The random combination of name/weapon/health/speed/damage for the procedural fights can cause some zany results.
